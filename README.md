# CPPND: Capstone Pong-clone Repo (Option 2)

This is a repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) Course.

In this Capstone Project I try to integrate what I've learned choosing option 2: cloning a classic game. I choose the classic Pong game.
